First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisers Xiaoli Chu, Sumei Sun, Alastair Buckley, and Tony Q.S. Quek for their continuous support of my Ph.D. study and related research, for their constructive feedback, motivation, patience, and immense knowledge. Their guidance helped me during the time of research and writing of this thesis. 

I thank my fellow Ph.D. students for the stimulating discussions, for the exchange of information, and for the companionship we have had in the last four years.

My sincere thanks also goes to the University of Sheffield and A*STAR for setting up this opportunity of doing research in two different countries and environments. 

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and friends in Germany, Sheffield, and Singapore. Special thanks go to my parents and my siblings for supporting me mentally throughout writing this thesis and my whole life.
